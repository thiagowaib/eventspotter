# EventSpotter

**Soon to be released...**

EventSpotter is a web application designed to help users discover local events or events in any chosen location. It provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences, event popularity, and location trends. Built with the power of **Next.js** and **Firebase**, the platform offers an optimized and modern event discovery experience for users and a simple yet powerful management interface for event organizers.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Event Search & Recommendation**: Users can search for events by category (concerts, festivals, meetups), location, or date. Recommendations are offered based on past user interactions and popular events in the selected location.
  
- **Organizer Event Management**: Registered users can create and manage their events, set event details like location, date, and capacity, and offer virtual tickets.

- **SEO Optimized Pages**: Each event has a dedicated, dynamically generated page using **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**, ensuring it is easily found by search engines.

- **User Interaction Analytics**: Using **Firebase Analytics**, the platform tracks user interactions, clicks, page views, and ticket purchases, giving event organizers insights into audience behavior.

- **Notifications & Alerts**: Users can manage notifications for upcoming events they are interested in or favorite, powered by **Firebase Cloud Messaging**.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: Used for Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG) to ensure fast page loads and SEO optimization.

  - Hosting
  - Firestore (database for event and user data)
